<strong>DAY 4: FEBRUARY 17 , 2019</strong> 

Today's Progress: Got more comfortable with methods, objects and using 'this'. Also learned about booleans which can either be set to true or false.

Thoughts: I really like this professor and have cleared up some gaps in my knowledge.

<strong>DAY 5: FEBRUARY 18 , 2019</strong> 

Today's Progress: Learned about the  ! bang property. It basically takes a boolean value and gets its opposite. This is helpful when we want to toggle something in JS. we also went over for loops. i was previously familair with for loops so most of this was review. He cleared up some loops in my knowledge like when to when we use i inside the function it will be the current item we are on in the loop. Kind of confusiong but working through it. 

Thoughts: For loops arfe kind of confusing but working through it.

<strong>DAY 6: FEBRUARY 19 , 2019</strong> 

Today's Progress: Today we continued with if else statements and combined it with a for loop. The teacher also stated that we usually use === instead of == when writing JS. === is stricter than ==.  

Thoughts: Combining for loops and if else statements is confusing. I also have to remember when i am inside a for loop i have to specify the instance i am on within the loop by using [i].

<strong>DAY 7: FEBRUARY 20 , 2019</strong> 

Today's Progress: Today we finished the toggle switch. The toggle switch was comprised of an if else stament which included for loops as well to run through each array item. We also learned about JS data types Objects and Primitives. When we compare primitives it's common sense. If it looks the same it will return true if it doesn't it will return false. The same is nto true for objects. They are a bit more complex. When we compare objects they will return fasle unless we are comparing the object to its exact self meaning meaning comparing 2 objects that look the same written out will return false because they are technically not the same object....We also learned that computers view objects as an address and not as a physical representation like we think it does. Meaning, if you refer to a object when declaring it as a variable it will "go" to that object address. It doesn't assign it as a new object to that variable. 

Thoughts: It helps to learn the nitty gritty stuff AKA the "science.

<strong>DAY 8: FEBRUARY 21 , 2019</strong> 

Today's Progress: Today we learned how to manipulagte an object on the DOM which was really just review for me. We also learned how run the debugger in the console. It is SO cool. you place where you want the script to stop running and you can view it in like a play by play fashion and with tons of helpful tools to better understand code you are viewing. 

Thoughts: Can't wait to use the debugger IRL.

<strong>DAY 9: FEBRUARY 22 , 2019</strong> 

Today's Progress: Today we played around with the debugger statement a bit more. We also started to refactgor our code, specifically the code dealing with add event listeners to the buttons we added. We used "onclick" handlers instead. We made an pbject called "handlers" and then added properties displayTodos and toggleAll , which were set to our "onclick" values in the HTML file. This onclick acts a s an event Lsitneer and in stops us from having to write out 2 varibale for defining what we want to get from the DOM. It is already in place on our HTML file with thsi "onclick" handler.

Thoughts: Learning how to refactor is diffuclt but it is cool to see your code shrink down.

<strong>DAY 10: FEBRUARY 23 , 2019</strong> 

Today's Progress: Today we finished making buttons for each of our todo list's features. I learned about .valueAsNumber when we want a value returned as a number and not a string. We also are starting to move away from displaying everything in the console to the actual webpage. 

Thoughts: Getting a lot more comfortable with the syntax but having a hard time grasping how we need to set up an object or a for loop to achieve a task.

<strong>DAY 11: FEBRUARY 24 , 2019</strong> 

Today's Progress: Today we made each li element contain todoText. We also made each li element have an indicator of it's status of completed or not. We learned about .textContent which setds an elements text content to be something. We also learned about .setTimeOut which delays the runnninf of a function. We finally finshed off with learning about forEach which actgs like a for loop and can be run on arrays and is a lot shorter.

Thoughts: This si becoming habit now and I hope it becomes easier for me to write code from scratch.

<strong>DAY 12: FEBRUARY 25, 2019</strong> 

Today's Progress: Today we learned that you need to explicitly tell a function to return a value at the end by having a return statement. Higher order fxs are fxs that accept other fxs. Callback fxs are the fxs that get passed into higher order fxs. Passing in "event" as the paramater of a fx will spit out mouseEvent which contains a lot fo info we can work with such as as target and parentNode. 

Thoughts: Learned a lot today.

<strong>DAY 13: FEBRUARY 26, 2019</strong> 

Today's Progress: Today we made each li item have a dlete button that will appear next to it when we add an item to the list. We learned a bout event delegation. Event delegation is when you place an EL on a parent element and then delegate when to run a function when certain criteria is met within that parent element the EL is on. Example We place an EL on an <ul> and then we specify which element and which fx to run whenver a child element of UL is clicked or interacted with. 

Thoughts: The clarification of event delegation at the end of todays lecture helped a lot.

<strong>DAY 14: FEBRUARY 27, 2019</strong> 

Today's Progress: Today we rafactored some code. We had 2 for loops that were code heavy and we refactored them using forEach method. forEach is used to iterate over arrays, just like a for loop, but requires less code. 

Thoughts: I like forEach method because it is much easier to read and understand

<strong>DAY 15: FEBRUARY 28, 2019</strong> 

Today's Progress: Finished the todo lis app by writing one more forEach statement. Then we reviewed using .this in different scenarios. I got REALLY confused towards the end of today's lessona when thinking about callback functions. Spent like an extra hour researching them and I still don't understand them.....

Thoughts: Feeling discouraged becasue I'm tired and giving up trying to understand a callback function for the night. Will continue tomorrow

<strong>DAY 16: MARCH 2, 2019</strong> 

Today's Progress: Strated a new course called JavaScript30. We built a drumkit. It seems a bit too complex and fast for me. Lot's of questions came up and the teacher is not great.. don't know if I should continue..

Thoughts: May switch courses...not sure

<strong>DAY 17: MARCH 4, 2019</strong> 

Today's Progress: I didn't continue with wes bos course as it was tooa dbvanced for me. I am sticking with Brad Traversy course for now. Today we started a new DOM practice project that caluclates your payemnt amount for a loan. toFixed is a method that sets a number value to a decimal it takes in how many deciamls you want as a parameter. parseFLoat also turns a number into a decimal. 

Thoughts: Was feeling discouraged becasue Id din't know what course to take next. Each one i tried was way too advacned for me. Will stick witht this course as it seems well sutied for me and my level.

<strong>DAY 18: MARCH 5, 2019</strong> 

Today's Progress: Today we started a new project called the guessing game. You need to guess a number between 1 and 10 and you get 3 trys. I really wanted to use my brain on this one, menaing to try and code it out myself without watching the video. It went...soso. I generated a erandom number from 1-10 on my own but got stuck trying to get user input value and store from the DOM. I was trying to just go directly to th DOM element and grab it when it reality you need to listen for an event (click) and then run a function (store the variable).

Thoughts: Glad I attempted to start porject on my own.

<strong>DAY 19: MARCH 6, 2019</strong> 

Today's Progress: Today we added more functionality ot the game. We added an if statement to validatge the inputted number abides by or rules (checked to see if a number and if within game range). We also used an if else statement to see if the guess entered matched our winning number or not. We then refactored this code

Thoughts: Followed through on trying to code before wstching the solutiona nd made some more progress. Made an else statement compare our winning number and checked to see if ti matched. Starting to enjoy JS a bit.

<strong>DAY 20: MARCH 7, 2019</strong> 

Today's Progress: Finished the number guessing game. Learned the difference between mousedown and click. Click is instant and mouse down happens once mouse button is released. Also learned about event bubbling and hoisting.

Thoughts: I really liked this project

<strong>DAY 21: MARCH 9, 2019</strong> 

Today's Progress: Today we learned about constructor fxs. A constructor fx is a way to efficiently make objects. We use a capital letter to name the fxs unlike camle case for a normal function. You give the constructor fx parameters and then inside the fx you tell it either what "categories" to have in the fx or you can have the constructor fx runa another fx inside of it (a method). to use a constructor fx you do const example = new NameOfConstructorFx(parameter 1, paramter 2);.

Thoughts: Getting a bit more difficult but just gotta keep pushing through and researching things i dont understand from as many sources as possible. Getting different viewpoints on the same topic helps SO much.

Link to work: NA




<strong>DAY 22: MARCH 10, 2019</strong> 

Today's Progress: Today we continued learning about constructor fxs and dove into prototypes. Each object comes with a built prototype, which is an object itself. These are helpful because we can store methods(AKA fxs) inside of these prototype objects and have other objects inherit these prototype methods (fxs). 

Thoughts: This is getting progressively more challenging but BRING IT ON.
