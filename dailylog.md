<strong>DAY 4: FEBRUARY 17 , 2019</strong> 

Today's Progress: Got more comfortable with methods, objects and using 'this'. Also learned about booleans which can either be set to true or false.

Thoughts: I really like this professor and have cleared up some gaps in my knowledge.

<strong>DAY 5: FEBRUARY 18 , 2019</strong> 

Today's Progress: Learned about the  ! bang property. It basically takes a boolean value and gets its opposite. This is helpful when we want to toggle something in JS. we also went over for loops. i was previously familair with for loops so most of this was review. He cleared up some loops in my knowledge like when to when we use i inside the function it will be the current item we are on in the loop. Kind of confusiong but working through it. 

Thoughts: For loops arfe kind of confusing but working through it.

<strong>DAY 6: FEBRUARY 19 , 2019</strong> 

Today's Progress: Today we continued with if else statements and combined it with a for loop. The teacher also stated that we usually use === instead of == when writing JS. === is stricter than ==.  

Thoughts: Combining for loops and if else statements is confusing. I also have to remember when i am inside a for loop i have to specify the instance i am on within the loop by using [i].

<strong>DAY 7: FEBRUARY 20 , 2019</strong> 

Today's Progress: Today we finished the toggle switch. The toggle switch was comprised of an if else stament which included for loops as well to run through each array item. We also learned about JS data types Objects and Primitives. When we compare primitives it's common sense. If it looks the same it will return true if it doesn't it will return false. The same is nto true for objects. They are a bit more complex. When we compare objects they will return fasle unless we are comparing the object to its exact self meaning meaning comparing 2 objects that look the same written out will return false because they are technically not the same object....We also learned that computers view objects as an address and not as a physical representation like we think it does. Meaning, if you refer to a object when declaring it as a variable it will "go" to that object address. It doesn't assign it as a new object to that variable. 

Thoughts: It helps to learn the nitty gritty stuff AKA the "science.

<strong>DAY 8: FEBRUARY 21 , 2019</strong> 

Today's Progress: Today we learned how to manipulagte an object on the DOM which was really just review for me. We also learned how run the debugger in the console. It is SO cool. you place where you want the script to stop running and you can view it in like a play by play fashion and with tons of helpful tools to better understand code you are viewing. 

Thoughts: Can't wait to use the debugger IRL.

<strong>DAY 9: FEBRUARY 22 , 2019</strong> 

Today's Progress: Today we played around with the debugger statement a bit more. We also started to refactgor our code, specifically the code dealing with add event listeners to the buttons we added. We used "onclick" handlers instead. We made an pbject called "handlers" and then added properties displayTodos and toggleAll , which were set to our "onclick" values in the HTML file. This onclick acts a s an event Lsitneer and in stops us from having to write out 2 varibale for defining what we want to get from the DOM. It is already in place on our HTML file with thsi "onclick" handler.

Thoughts: Learning how to refactor is diffuclt but it is cool to see your code shrink down.

<strong>DAY 10: FEBRUARY 23 , 2019</strong> 

Today's Progress: Today we finished making buttons for each of our todo list's features. I learned about .valueAsNumber when we want a value returned as a number and not a string. We also are starting to move away from displaying everything in the console to the actual webpage. 

Thoughts: Getting a lot more comfortable with the syntax but having a hard time grasping how we need to set up an object or a for loop to achieve a task.

<strong>DAY 11: FEBRUARY 24 , 2019</strong> 

Today's Progress: Today we made each li element contain todoText. We also made each li element have an indicator of it's status of completed or not. We learned about .textContent which setds an elements text content to be something. We also learned about .setTimeOut which delays the runnninf of a function. We finally finshed off with learning about forEach which actgs like a for loop and can be run on arrays and is a lot shorter.

Thoughts: This si becoming habit now and I hope it becomes easier for me to write code from scratch.

<strong>DAY 12: FEBRUARY 25, 2019</strong> 

Today's Progress: Today we learned that you need to explicitly tell a function to return a value at the end by having a return statement. Higher order fxs are fxs that accept other fxs. Callback fxs are the fxs that get passed into higher order fxs. Passing in "event" as the paramater of a fx will spit out mouseEvent which contains a lot fo info we can work with such as as target and parentNode. 

Thoughts: Learned a lot today.

<strong>DAY 13: FEBRUARY 26, 2019</strong> 

Today's Progress: Today we made each li item have a dlete button that will appear next to it when we add an item to the list. We learned a bout event delegation. Event delegation is when you place an EL on a parent element and then delegate when to run a function when certain criteria is met within that parent element the EL is on. Example We place an EL on an <ul> and then we specify which element and which fx to run whenver a child element of UL is clicked or interacted with. 

Thoughts: The clarification of event delegation at the end of todays lecture helped a lot.

<strong>DAY 14: FEBRUARY 27, 2019</strong> 

Today's Progress: Today we rafactored some code. We had 2 for loops that were code heavy and we refactored them using forEach method. forEach is used to iterate over arrays, just like a for loop, but requires less code. 

Thoughts: I like forEach method because it is much easier to read and understand

<strong>DAY 15: FEBRUARY 28, 2019</strong> 

Today's Progress: Finished the todo lis app by writing one more forEach statement. Then we reviewed using .this in different scenarios. I got REALLY confused towards the end of today's lessona when thinking about callback functions. Spent like an extra hour researching them and I still don't understand them.....

Thoughts: Feeling discouraged becasue I'm tired and giving up trying to understand a callback function for the night. Will continue tomorrow

<strong>DAY 16: MARCH 2, 2019</strong> 

Today's Progress: Strated a new course called JavaScript30. We built a drumkit. It seems a bit too complex and fast for me. Lot's of questions came up and the teacher is not great.. don't know if I should continue..

Thoughts: May switch courses...not sure

Link to work: https://github.com/dmking0728/drum-kit



<strong>DAY 17: MARCH 4, 2019</strong> 

Today's Progress: I didn't continue with wes bos course as it was tooa dbvanced for me. I am sticking with Brad Traversy course for now. Today we started a new DOM practice project that caluclates your payemnt amount for a loan. toFixed is a method that sets a number value to a decimal it takes in how many deciamls you want as a parameter. parseFLoat also turns a number into a decimal. 

Thoughts: Was feeling discouraged becasue Id din't know what course to take next. Each one i tried was way too advacned for me. Will stick witht this course as it seems well sutied for me and my level.

<strong>DAY 18: MARCH 5, 2019</strong> 

Today's Progress: Today we started a new project called the guessing game. You need to guess a number between 1 and 10 and you get 3 trys. I really wanted to use my brain on this one, menaing to try and code it out myself without watching the video. It went...soso. I generated a erandom number from 1-10 on my own but got stuck trying to get user input value and store from the DOM. I was trying to just go directly to th DOM element and grab it when it reality you need to listen for an event (click) and then run a function (store the variable).

Thoughts: Glad I attempted to start porject on my own.

Link to work: https://github.com/dmking0728/number-guessing-game



<strong>DAY 19: MARCH 6, 2019</strong> 

Today's Progress: Today we added more functionality ot the game. We added an if statement to validatge the inputted number abides by or rules (checked to see if a number and if within game range). We also used an if else statement to see if the guess entered matched our winning number or not. We then refactored this code

Thoughts: Followed through on trying to code before wstching the solutiona nd made some more progress. Made an else statement compare our winning number and checked to see if ti matched. Starting to enjoy JS a bit.

<strong>DAY 20: MARCH 7, 2019</strong> 

Today's Progress: Finished the number guessing game. Learned the difference between mousedown and click. Click is instant and mouse down happens once mouse button is released. Also learned about event bubbling and hoisting.

Thoughts: I really liked this project

<strong>DAY 21: MARCH 9, 2019</strong> 

Today's Progress: Today we learned about constructor fxs. A constructor fx is a way to efficiently make objects. We use a capital letter to name the fxs unlike camle case for a normal function. You give the constructor fx parameters and then inside the fx you tell it either what "categories" to have in the fx or you can have the constructor fx runa another fx inside of it (a method). to use a constructor fx you do const example = new NameOfConstructorFx(parameter 1, paramter 2);.

Thoughts: Getting a bit more difficult but just gotta keep pushing through and researching things i dont understand from as many sources as possible. Getting different viewpoints on the same topic helps SO much.

Link to work: NA




<strong>DAY 22: MARCH 10, 2019</strong> 

Today's Progress: Today we continued learning about constructor fxs and dove into prototypes. Each object comes with a built prototype, which is an object itself. These are helpful because we can store methods(AKA fxs) inside of these prototype objects and have other objects inherit these prototype methods (fxs). 

Thoughts: This is getting progressively more challenging but BRING IT ON. 

Link to work: NA




<strong>DAY 23: MARCH 11, 2019</strong> 

Today's Progress: Today we learned about using class. It is an ES6 way of creating a constructor fx. We also learned about extending a class which basically utilizes another constructor fx on a new object instance (blueprint, version whatever you want to call it). you do it by calling the prveiopus the function onto your new instance and then calling super inside of this instance. I also spent sometime refamiliarizing myself with objects and coinstructor fxs. All this new stuff was confusing me so i spent some time looking at hwat an object was again. An object is simply a collection of key value pairs related to a certain main thing ( cup is the object and color: red would be its key value pair). A constructor fxs allows us to create a blueprint to help us build stuff faster. For example a dog constructor fx can give usa solid base to start from and contain some the base key valu pairs related to a basic dog (color, size, breed) then we can create a new instance of this constructor as the base and to it as needed.

Thoughts: Getting confused but looking back at the fundamentals really helps so i dont get too hung up certain concepts. 

Link to work: NA




<strong>DAY 24: MARCH 12, 2019</strong> 

Today's Progress: We starte d anew project to help reinforce constructor fxs. it a simple book tracking porejct that lets you add a book with title, author and isbn as the main labels.

Thoughts: This projects is confusing me.......will research more on why we did what we did. 
Link to work: https://github.com/dmking0728/book-list




<strong>DAY 25: MARCH 13, 2019</strong> 

Today's Progress: Today we created a prototype to have an alert appear if user did not input anything, if they left a field blank, or if they submitted everything.

Thoughts: This projects is still confusing me.......will research more on why we did what we did. 
Link to work: https://github.com/dmking0728/book-list




<strong>DAY 26: MARCH 16, 2019</strong> 

Today's Progress: Today we converted our ES5 into ES6. I like how ES6 is visually easier to read than ES5. We then had a bonus lecture where we made our project persist to local storage. This had me really confused..Like i couldnt even folllow along to half of the thing she was saying. 

Thoughts: Finshed the project still confsued on a lot of things.

<strong>DAY 27: MARCH 17, 2019</strong> 

Today's Progress: Today we learned about working with JSON files. We create an XHR object , then we open the JSON file we will be working with by saying xhr.open('GET', 'filename.json', true); Then we create an onload fx to make sure stauts is 200 (AKA good)and tell it what to do once we have JSON data
xhr.onload = function() {
if(this.status === 200){
  do something with data
  }
 }
JSON is used to load data from a 3rd party asynchronously meaning it doesn't have to reload entire page. 

Thoughts: Learned a lot today. Excited to work more with APIs.
Link to work: NA




<strong>DAY 28: MARCH 18, 2019</strong> 

Today's Progress: Today we started a new project to help reinforce working with APIs. We used a chuck norris joke generator API and used it the data we requested from it (GET reuqest) to populate a li. You can choose how many jokes you would like to view. 

Thoughts: For some reason i understand APIs more than prototypes. APIs are pretty cool.
Link to work: https://github.com/dmking0728/Chuck-Norris




<strong>DAY 29: MARCH 20, 2019</strong> 

Today's Progress: Today we learned more about GET requests. we started another project thta will have us working with a mock API and JSon data that replicates user's and their comments. We first built a constructor fx that creates a new XMLHttpRequest(); and then we set a prototype of that constructor fx to .get and it makes a GET request and checks if it reutrns with 200 status. 

Thoughts: I take back my last thought...this is getting more difficult. Onwards!
Link to work: NA





<strong>DAY 30: MARCH 21, 2019</strong> 

Today's Progress: Today we finshed making our basic API request constructor fx. It now can GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE items within the API. At first this was confusing but it's starting to make a bit more sense. 
Thoughts: I like APIs again lol
Link to work: NA




<strong>DAY 31: MARCH 23, 2019</strong> 

Today's Progress: Today we started to learn about promises. I guess it is similar to a callback fx but it makes our code easier to read and doesn;t require us to enst as much. We also learned about fetchAPI and it is just another way to make requests to an api with better syntax.
Thoughts: Very confused today with the intro of pormises and fetch API. Feeling very doscouraged today. I think i should gear my skill level to be a UI developer instead a a front end developer. It seems a UI developer works mostly with HTMl CSS and ligth JS manipulation which is what i am comfortable with.
